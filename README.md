## Why Feature toggle?

> This is a common concept, but why use this directive instead solve it via server-side rendering?

The idea of this directive is make this process transparent and easier. So the main point is integrate this directive with other tooling process, such as:
- Server-side rendering;
- Progressive rendering;
- Any other that yoy like :)

You can integrate with WebSockets or handling this in a EventSourcing architecture. It's totally transparent for you and you can integrate easier in your application
